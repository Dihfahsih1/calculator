# Implementing a calculator in python

## Project Prerequisites

The only library that will be required to create python calculator project is the tkinter library, which we will use to create the GUI.

This library comes pre-installed with python, so you wonâ€™t have to worry about installing it.


## Calculator Program File Structure

Here are all the steps you will have to perform before you can readily play with your new project:

Making all the necessary imports.

Defining a master window and creating the top portion of the calculator.

Defining the functions of adding text and performing the calculations.

Creating and placing the numbers, operators, equal sign, all clear, and clear buttons.
